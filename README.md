# Game Scraper

Game scraper is a Bash script that creates an iso of whatever disk is in the disk drive.
I created this with the porpuse of creating ISO files for emulation.
This can be probably used for operating systems as well but it is not tested and ment to work for 
this porpuse.

# Important
If you are to use this script make sure that the disk drive is in the path /dev/sr0.
If it isn't you can change it manually by updating the script to your liking.
